polygon1=" Polygons are two-dimensional geometric figures with straight sides that are fully closed, consisting of three or more sides and angles. The simplest polygon is the triangle, with three sides, followed by quadrilaterals with four sides. Polygons can be classified based on their sides and angles into regular and irregular types. Regular polygons have all sides and angles equal, such as equilateral triangles and squares, while irregular polygons have sides and angles that are not equal. Polygons are further categorized by the number of sides they have: pentagons have five sides, hexagons have six, heptagons have seven, and so on. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is determined by the formula"
