Square1 = "A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides, four vertices, and four angles, characterized by the property that the sum of its interior angles is always 360 degrees. Quadrilaterals come in various forms, including squares, where all sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees; rectangles, which have equal opposite sides and right angles; rhombuses, with all sides equal but angles that are not necessarily right angles; parallelograms, featuring opposite sides that are parallel and equal in length; and trapezoids (or trapeziums), which have at least one pair of parallel opposite sides. Despite their differences in shape and size, all quadrilaterals share the defining feature of having four sides."
