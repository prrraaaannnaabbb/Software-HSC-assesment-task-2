nonpoly2 = "Geometric figures such as ellipses, defined by their oval shape with two focal points, play crucial roles in celestial mechanics, representing the orbits of planets and satellites. Non-polygons contribute significantly to mathematics, physics, and engineering by providing models for complex systems and phenomena that cannot be adequately described by polygons alone. Their study enhances our understanding of curved geometries and their applications across various scientific disciplines."
