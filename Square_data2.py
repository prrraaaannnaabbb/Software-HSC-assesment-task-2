Square2 ="Trapezoids have at least one pair of parallel sides and can include isosceles trapezoids, with equal non-parallel sides and base angles, and right trapezoids, with two right angles. Lastly, kites have two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal, one pair of equal opposite angles, and diagonals that intersect at right angles with one bisecting the other. Despite their differences, all quadrilaterals share the defining feature of having four sides."
